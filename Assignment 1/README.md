# This week we would be simply implementing the SHA256 cryptographic hashing function on some string.

The main code file for this week is sha.js , it would require the user to enter a string and it would give the smallest number that is to be appended on the string so that the cryptographic hash comes out to be smaller then the hex target chosen.

The sha.js file has the cryptographic function written in itself so the file is self-sufficient . To run on a local PC all the packages within package-lock.json and package.json are first to be installed using npm install .
