# This week we look upon implementing RSA Algorithm to verify our public-key private-key pair.

So here is a set of simple programs which are to be run in order to get the work done.

1) - public.pem - File containing public key. Not to be used directly , it works in the background .
2) - private.pem - File containing private key. Not to be used directly , it works in the background .
