# This week we would be implementing cryptographic RSA Algorithm to crypt some random data. 

The main code is present main.js
generate.js if run will create a public key - private key pair which would be stored under public.pem and private.pem respectively.
The keys in these .pem files are automatically taken by the main.js file and this would show the check results for these key value pair.

The file un-encrypted.md contains the message to be encrypted using RSA Algorithm. Run the main.js code to encrypt the data in un-encrypted.md using RSA Algorithm and store it in encrypted.md
