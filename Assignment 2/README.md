# This week we look upon implementing RSA Algorithm to verify our public-key private-key pair.

So here is a set of simple programs which are to be run in order to get the work done.

1) - public.pem - File containing public key. Not to be used directly , it works in the background .
2) - private.pem - File containing private key. Not to be used directly , it works in the background .
3) - un-encrypted.txt - It would contain the currect original text enterred by the user. Again it works in the backend only .
4) - encrypted.txt - It would contain the currect RSA encrypted using private key in the private.pem file at the time of encryption. Again it works in the backend only .
5) - package.json - contains information of all Dependencies.
6) - package-lock.json - used for installation of all Dependencies on remote device using npm install command.
7) -
