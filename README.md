# Blocks-and-Chains
This is a repository talking about my first project ðŸ˜Š on Blocks and Chains.
And I am excited to learn more about Cryptographic Hash Functions ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š.

To see each week's assignment go in the respective folder and "help.md" file has all the instructions.

Week 1 - Used SHA256 Hash Function.

Week 2 - Implemented RSA Algorithm.
