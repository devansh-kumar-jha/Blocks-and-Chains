# Blocks-and-Chains
This is a repository talking about my first project ðŸ˜Š on Blocks and Chains.
And I am excited to learn more about Cryptographic Hash Functions ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š.

To see each week's assignment go in the respective folder and see the instructions in "README.md" of that week.

Week 1 - Used SHA256 Hash Function.

Week 2 - Implemented RSA Algorithm.

Week 3 - Understanding the fundamental structure of Block-chains.

Week 4 - Reading a Block-Chain data from a Binary file.

Week 5 - Representation of a Block and Block mining.

Week 6 - Theoretical Advancement into Blocks and Chains and web-servers.
